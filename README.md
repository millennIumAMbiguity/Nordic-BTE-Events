## Welcome to the Nordic BTE Events website

[Join the Norid BTE Discord server here!](https://discord.gg/vMzDkJa)

We are a community dedicated to creating the world as it stands today in Minecraft, 1:1 scale.

If you came from the youtube video, thanks for watching! If you haven't, you should check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_bW3ab8YAk)

If you want to participate in this project, here's what you can do. Load up "Planet Earth" in the Terra 1:1 mod. The required mods to make this work can be found in #info on the Discord server. Then locate the region you would like to work on, and make a few buildings or city blocks as a sample of your work. Make sure your work is done in the Terra 1:1 Planet Earth world. 

Once you're satisfied, take a video or screenshot. This is your application. [Upload it or link it in this form as your official submission to become a builder.](https://forms.gle/kiYH7NoHgenuDpva8)

If you are approved, your discord role will be changed to "I BUILD", and you will gain access to the official channel of your country/domain and be contracted as an official builder for the project!!
